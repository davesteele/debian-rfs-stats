debian-rfs-stats
================

Statistics and charts for the Debian Request for Sponsor process

The charts themselves can be seen [here](http://davesteele.github.io/debian-rfs-stats/).

To replicate, clone, install python-sqlalchemy, create a directory "./tmp", and run "./bin/processrfs.py". Data files are created in "./data". Once that is done, you can serve the pages from a web server. Do not expect access file file:// urls to work.
